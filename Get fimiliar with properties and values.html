    <h1>Urban LegendsðŸ–¤</h1>
    <p>
      Urban legends are stories that are often mysterious, frightening, or
      humorous, and are sometimes used to teach a lesson. They can be told as
      complete stories with characters and plots.
    </p>
    <h2>Examples of urban legends:</h2>

    <h3 id="spooky1">The Hookman</h3>
    <p>
      The Hookman legend has been around for many decades, with variations
      appearing across the United States and beyond.The hook for a hand is a
      terrifying image, representing a deformed, monstrous figure. It also taps
      into the fear of the unknownâ€”the possibility that someone or something may
      be lurking just out of sight.The legend was particularly popular in the
      1950s and 1960s but still remains a staple of horror folklore.
    </p>
    <h3 class="spooky2">The Choking Doberman</h3>
    <p>
      The Choking Doberman is a well-known urban legend that combines horror,
      suspense, and a dramatic twist.The legend appeals to peopleâ€™s deep-seated
      fears of home invasion, the vulnerability of being alone, and the
      potential for violence hiding behind seemingly normal events.
    </p>
    <h3 id="spooky1">The Slender Man</h3>
    <p>
      A tall, faceless figure dressed in black with tentacle-like appendages,
      Slender Man is said to stalk children, often leading them away from their
      homes. Although it originated as an internet meme, it has since become a
      widely known urban legend with tragic real-life events connected to it.
    </p>
    <h3 class="spooky2">The Bloody Mary Ritual</h3>
    <p>
      This legend claims that if you stand in front of a mirror in a dark room
      and chant "Bloody Mary" three times, a ghostly figure will appear,
      sometimes to harm you. The story has been used as a spooky game for
      children daring each other to face the myth.
    </p>
    <h3 id="spooky1">The Haunted Phone Number</h3>
    <p>
      In this legend, someone calls a random phone number and hears eerie voices
      or strange occurrences on the other end. Some versions suggest that the
      number connects to the spirits of the dead, while others imply it is
      cursed or tied to an unsolved mystery.
